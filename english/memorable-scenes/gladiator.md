Movie: Gladiator c.2000

The distant crowd chanting in the background:

    "Maximus!.. Maximus!.. Maximus!"

Scene: Maximus stands with arms bound to out of frame supports that pull his arms outward as in a cross.
       Commodus saunters in to meet Maximus face to face. This is a man with inwardly malformed character.
       Having committed patricide years ago, he's riddled with subsequent neurotic guilt that has metasticized
       in his mind and spirit, now far past the point of psychosis. As though with unseen inhuman claws reaching
       out of the ground everwhere he walks, Hell tugs at his feet eager to claim and devour his flesh and
       spirit for eternity.

The Emperor Commodus to Maximus (with oozing arrogance masking his weakness)

    "They call for you... The general who became a slave."
    "The slave who became a gladiator. And a gladiator who defied an emperor."
    "Now that people want to know how the story ends only a famous death will do."
    "And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena."

Maximus to Commodus:

    "You would fight me?"

Commodus (with fear masked by indignance): "And why not?.. Do you think I'm afraid?"

Maximus (seeing through Commodus): "I think you've been afraid all your life."


The truth sears the inner wounds of Commodus. He parries weakly and pathetically, saying


Commodus (weak sarcastic retort): "Unlike Maximus the invincible.. who knows no fear?!"

Maximus (with tired chuckling of a man of unparalleled strength of character and clear conscience): "he-he-he..."

Maximus (now drawing from the deep interior well of strength and vitality, he straightens himself with piercing gaze):

    "I knew a man who once said 'Death smiles at us all.'"
    "All a man can do is.. smile back."
